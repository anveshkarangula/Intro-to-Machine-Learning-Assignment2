Among all of the users, there are two categories: Random Clicker (RC), and Truthful Clicker (TC). There are two possible answers to the survey: yes and no. Random clickers would click either one with equal probability. You are also giving the information that the expected fraction of random clickers is 0.3.  After a trial period, you get the following survey results: 65\\% said Yes and 35\\% said No.   What fraction of people who are truthful clickers answered yes?  Hint: use the rule of total probability."

Give your table a short caption describing what is shown in the table.  \n",

The second set of steps operate on the result of the first set of steps; it would count the number of unique songs that appeared on the Top 100 in each year, _irrespective of how many times_ it had appeared."

If you find that your plot isn't readable with vertical bars, you can add a `coord_flip()` layer to your plot to make the bars (and labels) run horizontally instead.\n",
